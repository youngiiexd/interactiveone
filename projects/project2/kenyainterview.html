        <p>"As a profane, I consider ideograms more illustrative and latin letters more symbolic. Ideograms seem more versatile, for example you can set them both vertically or horizontally without comprosimsing legibility. Probably because ecah ideogram seems to be independent from the others."</p>

<p>I read you believe that the value of design is to enhance a spiritual awakening. Why and how design can enhance spirituality? Is this idea related to Japanese culture?<br>

Pride is important to me and since design is an accumulation of tradition and wisdom I am pride to share all of this through my work.<br><br>

In the Japanese aesthetics there is often a coexistence of tradition and innovation. The traditional component seems to be related to sobriety and nature. Can you apply this to your design?<br>

Probably, without my noticing, tradition is embedded in the very foundation of my sensory perception. Tradition is something that we want both to avoid and to protect, even as we rebel against it.<br><br>

I always like Takeo’s paper boy. Why does a Japanese paper manufacturing company – founded in 1899 – have a mark reproducing a xilography from a German book published in 1568.<br>

Takeo Co., Ltd. is a specialized paper trading company focusing on Western-paper, rather than Japanese paper. A former member of the board, Mr. Hiraku Kido, found the illustration at the British Museum, in the ‘Panoplia Omnium Liberalium Mechanicarum et Sedentariarum Artium Genera Contines’ by Jost Amman. And he decided to use the ‘paper-boy’ as an icon of Takeo. I’d like to make this point clear: I’m not the « founder » nor the « proposer » of that icon. What I did was to make it as a signature by brushing up the illustration and combining it together with the company logotype.<br><br>

A definition of good design.<br>

Good design has the power to rouse people. Not as an answer, but as a question.</p>
