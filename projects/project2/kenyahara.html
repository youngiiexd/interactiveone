    <img src="images/hara.jpg" width="600px">
    <p>Kenya Hara (Okayama, 1958). He is a leading international designer, best known for the art direction of MUJI, begun in 2001, through which he has brilliantly defined the company’s no brand identity. His design searches the spiritual sphere rather than the material one, exploring the experience of emptiness.

He has developed many sophisticated and intelligent projects, including several exhibitions in which he involved craftsmen, engineers, and internationally renowned designers, stimulating the search for innovative and surprising solutions.

Among the most famous exhibitions he produced there are Senseware, 2008, Haptic, 2004, and Re-Design, 2000, that won him two International Industrial Design Biennale Grand Prizes and the Mainichi Design Award. The newest exhibitions are Architecture for Dogs and House Vision, both 2013.

He collected many awards, including the Tokyo Art Directors Club Grand Prize for his advertising campaing of MUJI, the Kodansha Publishing Culture Award, and the Japan Inter Design Forum Prize.

He is also professor at Musashino Art University, member of the Nippon Design Center, President of Japan Design Committee, and Vice-President of Japan Graphic Designers Association.

The several successful books he wrote include Designing Design, 2007, and White, 2008, which have been translated into a number of languages and became two real bestsellers.
