        “Colors do not exist separately and independently within nature; they are constantly shifting in response to subtle gradations of light. It is language that, magnificently, gives them clear shape.” —White, Kenya Hara.
        </h3>

    <p>Kenya Hara (Okayama, 1958). He is a leading international designer, best known for the art direction of MUJI, begun in 2001, through which he has brilliantly defined the company’s no brand identity. His design searches the spiritual sphere rather than the material one, exploring the experience of emptiness.

<h2>Interview with Hara; by Nicola-Matteo Munari.</h2>  

<h5>I read you believe that the value of design is to enhance a spiritual awakening. Why and how design can enhance spirituality? Is this idea related to Japanese culture?</h5>

<p>"Pride is important to me and since design is an accumulation of tradition and wisdom I am pride to share all of this through my work."</p>

<h5>In the Japanese aesthetics there is often a coexistence of tradition and innovation. The traditional component seems to be related to sobriety and nature. Can you apply this to your design?</h5>

<p>"Probably, without my noticing, tradition is embedded in the very foundation of my sensory perception. Tradition is something that we want both to avoid and to protect, even as we rebel against it."</p>

    <h5>I always like Takeo’s paper boy. Why does a Japanese paper manufacturing company – founded in 1899 – have a mark reproducing a xilography from a German book published in 1568?</h5>

    <img src="images/takeoman.jpg" width="246px">

    <p>"Takeo is a specialized paper trading company focusing on Western-paper, rather than Japanese paper. A former member of the board, Mr. Hiraku Kido, found the illustration at the British Museum, in the Panoplia Omnium Liberalium Mechanicarum et Sedentariarum Artium Genera Contines by Jost Amman. And he decided to use the paper boy as an icon of Takeo. I would like to make this point clear: I am not the designer nor the proposer of that icon. What I did was to make it as a signature by brushing up the illustration and combining it together with the company logotype."</p>
